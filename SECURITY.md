# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

It is recommended to use the [latest](https://github.com/steveiliop56/tinyauth/releases/latest) available version of tinyauth. This is because it includes security fixes, new features and dependency updates. Older versions, especially major ones, are not supported and won't receive security or patch updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Due to the nature of this app, it needs to be secure. If you discover any security issues or vulnerabilities in the app please contact me as soon as possible at <steve@doesmycode.work>. Please do not use the issues section to report security issues as I won't be able to patch them in time and they may get exploited by malicious actors.
